This is the textbook for the [Intro to Neurotechnology](http://neurotech.berkeley.edu/) DeCal at UC Berkeley.

Welcome to the Neurotech Decal Textbook! We have created a collection of what we believe to be the most fundamental concepts regarding Neurotechnology and its applications. The recent revolution of research combining the scientific fields of neuroscience, engineering, and computer science advances the world as we know it to new avenues never foreseen by humankind. Let us together understand the ideas behind the study of the brain and behavior through the technological lens so that we, too, can be part of this revolution of ideas.

In the next pages, we will dive into the backbone of neurotechnology; the circuits underlying the structure of the brain, the techniques used to understand the brain, the ethics and the implications of our knowledge. In the next pages, you will become familiar with the science behind learning, memory, attention, consciousness, and more. You will learn how modern brain interface techniques work, whether that is the fMRI, TMS, or EEG. Finally, you will be granted the knowledge to move beyond this textbook and apply our fundamental concepts to real-world examples of neurotechnology use.

You will have the skill to investigate a broad range of neurotechnology applications, including neural imaging and sensing, neural prosthetics, brain-machine interfaces, neuropharmacology, and neurostimulation. Neurotechnology applies to virtually anything; from mental health care to video game control, from government security to neuromarketing, from trans-human connections to uncovering the depths of our consciousness. The tools we will explore in the following pages will direct us toward influencing the path of technological advancement as it relates to healthcare, business, and our daily lives.

*We are neurotech*

*Brain Computer Interface*

*It is the future*
